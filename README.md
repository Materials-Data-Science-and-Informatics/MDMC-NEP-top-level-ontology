## MDMC-NEP-top-level-ontology

This repository collects the ongoing work towards the development of the top-level ontology based on common terms defined for the Joint Lab 
"Integrated Model and Data Driven Materials Characterization" (MDMC) and for the "Nanoscience Foundries and Fine Analysis Europe Pilot" (NEP).
The top-level glossary defining the terms is available (as a living document which can be constantly updated) on the NEP website: https://www.nffa.eu/apply/data-policy/glossary

## Aim

The aim of this joint activity is to develop an ontology of top-level terms which can be initially adopted by MDMC and NEP. 
In future, it might also be adopted by other Materials Science projects. 
This will have the huge advantage of having a **common** description of concepts and relationships in the domain of Materials Science. 
This will offer a set of metadata which, in turn, will increase the interoperability and the reuse of data.

## Future extensions

The top-level ontology is planned to be extended thanks to the adoption of fine-grained ontologies already existing, 
e.g. the Material Science Lab Equipment (MSLE) Ontology.
