# SKOS Snapshots Directory

This directory stores timestamped snapshots of the PRIMA SKOS vocabulary
downloaded from SKOSMOS.

Each snapshot consists of:
- `{timestamp}.rdf` - RDF/XML snapshot file
- `{timestamp}-metadata.json` - Metadata about the snapshot
- `latest.rdf` - Symlink (or copy) pointing to the most recent snapshot

Snapshots are automatically created by the GitHub Actions workflow when changes
are detected, and can also be created manually using the CLI.
