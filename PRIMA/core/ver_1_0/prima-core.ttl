Examples of research data include statistics, output of experiments and/or measurements, observations resulting from fieldwork, survey results, recordings and images. According to this definition, raw data, processed data, analysed data and reference data are particular types of research data. Research data is typically in the form of a data file, but it may potentially be a data stream or any other form of data which is relevant in a particular data management context. Research data may be stored in a data collaboration platform and/or in a data repository. Research data may be part of a dataset."@en .
