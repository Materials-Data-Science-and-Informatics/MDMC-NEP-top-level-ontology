# MDMC glossary of terms
-----
This glossary, compiled by the MDMC Metadata Working Group, defines and explains the high-level terms used in the context of the MDMC (meta)data management. 
The definitions make use in a consistent way of glossary terms, which are written with Capital Initial Letters and linked to their respective definitions.  
This glossary is intended to be a living document, subject to updates if required by the community. For any inquire, please contact Dr. Rossella Aversa (rossella.aversa@kit.edu).

### Analysed Data
[Research Data](#research-data) which is the primary output of any kind of [Data Analysis](#data-analysis) performed on [Research Data](#research-data), typically on [Processed Data](#processed-data), by one or more [Research Users](#research-user), possibly using [Research Software](#research-software). [Analysed Data](#analysed-data) is typically in the form of a data file, but it may potentially be a data stream or any other form of data which is relevant in a particular data management context. [Analysed Data](#analysed-data) may be stored in a [Data Collaboration Platform](#data-collaboration-platform) and/or in a [Data Repository](#data-repository). [Analysed Data](#analysed-data) may be part of a [Dataset](#dataset).

### Conclusions
The primary output of [Data Interpretation](#data-interpretation) performed by one or more [Research Users](#research-user) on [Research Data](#research-data), typically on [Analysed Data](#analysed-data), possibly using [Research Software](#research-software). [Conclusions](#conclusions) are any kind of insight that support the answer to some specific research question, such as the significance and implications of the research findings of a [Study](#study), possibly in comparison with [Reference Data](#reference-data), along with recommendations which may support decision-making about the next steps of a [Study](#study) or about future work. [Conclusions](#conclusions) form an important part of a [Study](#study) debrief and are usually reported in [Scientific Publications](#scientific-publication). 

### Correlative Characterization
The action of characterizing one or more [Samples](#sample) (depending on the particular research context) and connecting the different types of information from co-referenced (in time or space) multi-dimensional [Research Data](#research-data). This may include the output of multiple [Measurement Techniques](#measurement-technique) or of any of the processes included in the [Data Analysis Lifecycle](#data-analysis-lifecycle) to obtain complementary insights on a region of interest, as well as to put into relation features of different [Sample](#sample) areas across multiple length scales or over time. 

### Data Analysis
Data treatment performed by one or more [Research Users](#research-user), who collect, model and analyse [Research Data](#research-data), typically [Processed Data](#processed-data), to extract insights that support the answer to some specific research question (i.e., [Conclusions](#conclusions)). [Data Analysis](#data-analysis)  may include: linear combination, data fitting, data modeling, pattern extraction. [Data Analysis](#data-analysis)  may be performed using [Research Software](#research-software). The output of [Data Analysis](#data-analysis) is [Analysed Data](#analysed-data). 

### Data Analysis Lifecycle
Set of processes carried out by one or more [Research Users](#research-user), who systematically perform actions and apply methods, e.g., statistical and/or logical techniques, on [Research Data](#research-data) in order to produce synthesized knowledge to, e.g., detect pattern, determine relationships, develop explanations, test hypotheses, prove theories, suggest the [Conclusions](#conclusions) of the [Study](#study). [Data Analysis Lifecycle](#data-analysis-lifecycle) includes (but is not limited to): [Data Processing](#data-processing), [Data Analysis](#data-analysis), [Data Interpretation](#data-interpretation). These processes may consist of different steps, may be iterative and may be combined in chains or workflows. [Data Analysis Lifecycle](#data-analysis-lifecycle) may be performed using [Research Software](#research-software). 

### Data Collaboration Platform
Operational information system which allows [Research Users](#research-user) to keep their [Research Data](#research-data), [Datasets](#dataset) and related documents (e.g., drafts of [Scientific Publications](#scientific-publication)) synchronized and up to date, and to exchange them with other [Research Users](#research-user), who are typically members of the same [Project](#project). The system is intended for the long-tail and still volatile data, which can change and are still subject to active research. Therefore, a [Data Collaboration Platform](#data-collaboration-platform) offers versioning of all ingested files but does not usually assign [Persistent Identifiers](#persistent-identifier) to them. 

### Data Interpretation
Process performed by one or more [Research Users](#research-user), who assign meaning to [Research Data](#research-data), typically [Analysed Data](#analysed-data), and determine the [Conclusions](#conclusions) of the [Study](#study), possibly in comparison with [Reference Data](#reference-data). [Data Interpretation](#data-interpretation) supports decision-making about the next steps of the [Study](#study) or about future work. [Data Interpretation](#data-interpretation) may be performed using [Research Software](#research-software).  

### Data Processing
Data treatment performed by one or more [Research Users](#research-user) on [Research Data](#research-data), typically [Raw Data](#raw-data), to prepare it for another step of the [Data Analysis Lifecycle](#data-analysis-lifecycle), e.g., [Data Analysis](#data-analysis) or [Data Interpretation](#data-interpretation). [Data Processing](#data-processing) usually consists of routine actions. It may include: filtering, denoising, transformation, fusion or compression of existing [Research Data](#research-data), as well as calibration, normalization, statistical data reduction, background subtraction, correction of artifacts. [Data Processing](#data-processing) may be performed using [Research Software](#research-software). The output of [Data Processing](#data-processing) is [Processed Data](#processed-data). 

### Data Repository

A [Data Repository](#data-repository) is particularly suitable for [Research Data](#research-data) (especially [Datasets](#dataset) and/or [Publication Data](#publication-data)) which are not likely to be altered again. Many [Data Repositories](#data-repository) automatically assign globally unique [Persistent Identifiers](#persistent-identifier) to deposited resources. [Data Repositories](#data-repository) may be associated with an [Institution](#institution) or a group of them, with an [Instrument](#instrument) or a group of them, or with a [Measurement Techniques](#measurement-technique) or a group of them, or may be run by a third party. [Data Repositories](#data-repository) may or may not be directly used by [Research Users](#research-user).

### Dataset
